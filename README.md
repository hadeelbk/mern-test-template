   - git clone (HTTPS link)
   - cd (root) 

2. Install dependencies
### Frontend
- cd client
- npm install

### Backend
- cd server
- npm install


## üõ† Environment Setup

- Before running the app, create a `.env` file in the server directory.

## Assumptions & Decisions
	‚Ä¢	Only one user can book a specific time slot (consumable slots)
	‚Ä¢	Used Material UI for a quick, clean UI
	‚Ä¢	Built time ranges: Morning: (10:00 AM ‚Äì 3:00 PM) and Afternoon: (3:45 ‚Äì 5:45) PM
	‚Ä¢	Docker used to streamline local dev and deployment
	‚Ä¢	No user authentication in this version (public booking only)
